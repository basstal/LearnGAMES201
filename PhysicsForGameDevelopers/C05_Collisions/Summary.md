# Collisions

## Impulse-Momentum Principle

For problems involving constant mass and moment of inertia, you can calculate the average impulse force and torque using the following equations:

$$\bold{F} = m(\bold{v}_+ - \bold{v}_-) / (t_+ - t_-)$$

$$\bold{M} = \bold{I}(\boldsymbol{\omega}_+ - \boldsymbol{\omega}_-) / (t_+ - t_-)$$

## Impact

$$m_1v_{1-}+m_2v_{2-} = m_1v_{1+} + m_2v_{2+}$$

Subscript - refers to the instant just prior to impact, + refers to the instant just after impact.


$$e = -(v_{1+} - v_{2+}) / (v_{1-} - v_{2-})$$

Here e is known as the coefficient of restitution and is a function of the colliding objects' material, construction, and geometry. For collisions that are neither perfectly inelastic(e is 0) nor perfectly elastic(e is 1) e can be any value between 0 and 1.
