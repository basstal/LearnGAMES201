# Kinetics

$$\bold{F} = m\bold{a}$$

$$\bold{M_{cg}} = \bold{I}\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$

Here is the general procedure for solving kinetics problems of interest to us:

1.	Calculate the bodyâ€™s mass properties (mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia).
2.	Identify and quantify all forces and moments acting on the body.
3.	Take the vector sum of all forces and moments.
4.	Solve the equations of motion for linear and angular accelerations.
5.	Integrate with respect to time to find linear and angular velocity.
6.	Integrate again with respect to time to find linear and angular displacement.
